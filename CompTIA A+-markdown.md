PCIe, or PCI Express (Peripheral Component Interconnect Express), is a high-speed serial computer expansion bus standard designed to replace the older PCI, PCI-X, and AGP bus standards.

The terms "PCIe x1" and "PCIe x16" refer to the different sizes of the slots on a motherboard and the number of lanes they provide for data transfer. The "x" refers to the number of lanes the slot has. So, "x1" has one lane, and "x16" has sixteen lanes.

Here are the key differences:

1. Data Transfer Rate: Since a PCIe x16 slot has 16 lanes for data to flow, it has a higher data transfer rate than a PCIe x1 slot which only has one lane. This can be particularly important in applications where high data bandwidth is required, such as in graphics cards.

2. Physical Size: A PCIe x16 slot is physically larger than a x1 slot. This is because it needs to accommodate more lanes for data transfer. This also means that you can plug a smaller PCIe card (like a x1) into a larger slot (like a x16), but you can't fit a larger PCIe card into a smaller slot.

3. Usage: PCIe x1 slots are often used for devices that don't require high bandwidth, such as sound cards, network cards, or USB expansion cards. On the other hand, PCIe x16 slots are generally used for graphics cards, which require a lot of bandwidth to function optimally.

Network Interface Card (NIC)

SATA uses a 7-pin L-shaped data connector with one device per port. SATA operates at bandwidths of 1.5 Gbps, 3 Gbps, or 6 Gbps. SATA drives can also use a 15-pin power connector. 

CPU Virtualization is a hardware feature found in all current AMD & Intel CPUs that allows a single processor to act as if it was multiple individual CPUs. This allows an operating system to more effectively & efficiently utilize the computer's CPU power to run faster.

An x86 or 32-bit processor can address a maximum of 4GB of RAM

DDR stands for Dual Data Rate

If you see for example PC3-10600 on a DDR memeory stick it usually means the transfer speed measured in MB/s so this stick would have 10,600 MegaBytes per second of throughput

When using a multi channel configurations, use the same model, speed, and throughput of memory

**ECC - Error Correcting Code**
Detects and corrects an error

Non-Parity memory does not check for errors and allows data to be put in or taken out. Cheap to manufacture

Parity memory performs basic error checking and ensures the memory contents reliable

**BIOS** Basic Input/Output System up to 32bit systems

**CMOS** is a battery on the motherboard. It saves the bios settings 

**POST** Power-on Self-Test

**TPM** Provides encrytion and checks the UEFI has not been tampered with and provides a secure boot-up
